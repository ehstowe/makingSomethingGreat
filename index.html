<h1>Making Something Great</h1>
<h2>Why is visualization effective?</h2>
<p>Visualization is an effective means to convey information because it often provides more truth than data alone. In 
<i>The Truthful Art</i>, Alberto Cairo retells a story of students who were happier to receive a 96/137 than a 72/100. 
A visualization of these numbers clearly shows that the 96 is a worse grade than the 72. Visualization allows users to 
better see relationships between pieces of data It is the best way to convey truth from data.p>
<h2>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</h2>
<p>A more effective way to encode data for perceptual tasks is by positioning data along common scales. This allows a 
  viewer to extract more accurate estimates from a chart or graph, as opposed to shading and saturation or color hue, which
  is far more general. Cairo discusses a hiearchy, or spectrum, or ways to display data, from most accurate to less accurate. A
  similar hierarchy was developed by statisticians Cleveland and McGill. The higher in the hierarchy your chart falls, the 
  more successful it will be at conveying data.</p>
<h2>What are the trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization?</h2>
<p>One trade-off Cairo considers is the tradeoff between showing both the big picture and the small details. It is 
  hard to do both, and often one must be traded off for another. Sometimes 
  this requires using more than one chart with different scales. 
  Similarly, there is a tradeoff between visual appeal and truthful data. 
  The stacked data charts shown on page 132 are visually appealing, but show distorted data - the non-stacked version on the bottom
  of the page is far more truthful. Cairo mentions that many data visualists like radar charts because they're pretty - but ultimately,
  they're confusing, and should be used carefully.</p>
