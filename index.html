<h1>Making Something Great</h1>
<h2>Why is visualization effective?</h2>
<p>Visualization is an effective means to convey information because it often provides more truth than data alone. In 
<i>The Truthful Art</i>, Alberto Cairo retells a story of students who were happier to receive a 96/137 than a 72/100. 
A visualization of these numbers clearly shows that the 96 is a worse grade than the 72. Visualization allows users to 
better see relationships between pieces of data.<p>
